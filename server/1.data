Love is an emotion that we all yearn for. Right from the day we are born we crave love. Little babies who just enter this world are unaware about what goes on around here. If there is one thing that they understand, it is love. They understand nothing else but love and crave for it. They long to be with their parents and grandparents as they can feel the love and warmth by their touch and behaviour. They hesitate and cry when a stranger picks them as the love quotient is lower or at times not there at all.

The mother-child relationship is said to be the strongest. The sole reason for it is love. There is immense love involved. The mother loves the child selflessly and the later reciprocates this love. As we grow up, we make friends, are introduced to teachers, relatives, neighbours and many other people. What is it that draws or repels us from a person? It is his nature. A person with a kind and loving nature is loved by all.
